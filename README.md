## Description
NodeHub is a Web3 platform built in the Solana ecosystem, designed to connect emerging startups with investors interested in supporting innovative projects in a transparent, traceable, and secure way.
The solution comes from the need to remove bureaucracy from early-stage investments, offering a decentralized and reliable environment where startups can present their ideas and investors can safely support them, all recorded on the blockchain.

In NodeHub, every investment is made through a smart contract, and the investor receives a tracking NFT, which works as proof of investment and a trust token. This NFT visually evolves as the startup reaches its goals, making the process more gamified and transparent.


### Main Differentiators

- Total transparency: All investments and updates are recorded on the Solana blockchain.

- Gamification: Dynamic NFTs evolve as the startup reaches defined milestones.

- Speed and low cost: Fast transactions with minimal fees, thanks to Solana's infrastructure.

- Direct connection: Communication without intermediaries between investors and entrepreneurs.
